### Mentorship eligibility results
* There are only 1,549 employees that are mentorship eligible. 
* The titles for mentorship eligible employees vary greatly, with some just being "staff" members, while some are more senior such as senior staff or senior engineer (https://github.com/awolfe95/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/Data/mentorship_eligibility.csv).

## Summary
* There are 90,398 roles that will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact (https://github.com/awolfe95/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/Data/retiring_count.csv_. This number was generated by taking the sum of the retiring titles table using the following query language: 
  *SELECT Sum (rt.count)
  *INTO retiring_count
  *FROM retiring_titles as rt;
